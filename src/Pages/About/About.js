           Being a curious mind and one who believes in the power
            of the knowledgeable mind, she started self tutoring herself in coding since 2017 using platforms like W3Schools, 
            Sololearn, BitDegree and others.
            Fortunately, in 2021, she enrolled in the Pre-MEST program at Whizzy Academy where she
            was trained and mentored in full stack development. 
            Her dream that skills should be available to all inspired the developing of 
            Thesaurus, an online platforn where people can find tutors, learning partners and virtual study rooms at 
            no cost. She is also in charge of High Hills Incorporated Thesaurus1 which is a free training in HTML, CSS and
            Javascript held on Whatsapp. She is a Christian and holds on to her religious and personal convictions in all her doings.
